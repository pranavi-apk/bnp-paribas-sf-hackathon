# BlueValue Intelligence: Institutional ESG Risk Terminal

![Terminal Header](assets/overview.png)

## Executive Summary
**BlueValue Intelligence** is a high-fidelity, institutional-grade analytical terminal designed for **Sustainable Finance Engineering** and **Sustainable Finance Engineering (SFE)** teams. It provides a cockpit for monitoring wastewater risk, simulating sustainability-linked loan (SLL) margin adjustments, and forensic auditing of facility-level ESG performance.

Born from the **BNP Paribas Structured Finance Hackathon**, this platform transforms raw wastewater data into actionable financial intelligence using the proprietary **Ocean Performance Score (OPS)** engine.

- **Financial Benefit Engine**: Dynamic calculation of SLL margin ratchet impact and annualized interest savings.
- **Portfolio Intelligence**: Comparative decile ranking against the broader BNP Paribas portfolio.

### 2. Technical Intelligence Hub (Forensic Deep-Dive)
A deep-audit workspace for technical risk officers and credit committees.
- **Forensic KPI Decomposition**: Granular audit view comparing internal metrics against portfolio medians and peer quartiles.
